## 📘 Overview

The **Arduino-Based Dual Axis Solar Tracking System** is an embedded automation project designed to continuously orient a solar panel toward the sun by tracking its movement across **both horizontal (azimuth)** and **vertical (elevation)** axes.

By leveraging **real-time sensor feedback** and **precise actuator control**, this system significantly improves solar energy capture compared to fixed or single-axis installations.

## 👤 About the Project

This project demonstrates the **practical application of embedded systems and renewable energy engineering**, integrating:

- Sensor data acquisition  
- Real-time decision-making  
- Servo motor control  
- Energy optimization logic  

The system is intentionally designed to be **low-cost, modular, and educational**, making it ideal for academic projects, demonstrations, and prototyping.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- ☀️ Real-time sun position detection using **LDR sensors**
- 🔄 Dual-axis tracking (horizontal + vertical)
- ⚙️ Servo motor–based precise panel alignment
- 🔋 Improved power efficiency vs fixed panels
- 🧩 Clean, modular Arduino code
- 📚 Beginner-friendly yet industry-relevant design

---

## 🧠 Working Principle

1. Four **Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs)** measure sunlight intensity from different directions.
2. The Arduino compares sensor values in real time.
3. Two servo motors adjust the panel orientation:
   - **Azimuth Axis** → East–West movement
   - **Elevation Axis** → Up–Down movement
4. The panel aligns itself toward the maximum light source.
5. This process runs continuously during daylight hours.
